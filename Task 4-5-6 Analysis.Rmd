## INSTALL LIBRARIES (ONCE)
```{r}
# install.packages("dplyr")
# install.packages("reldist")
```



## LOAD NECESSARY LIBRARYS
```{r}
library(reldist)
library(dplyr)
```

## SOME USEFUL FUNCTIONS
```{r}
# writing data frame to csv file
# write.csv2(<data table name>, "<path/filename.csv>")
# write.csv2(all_sequences, "/home/doberstein/Desktop/all_sequences.csv", row.names = F)

# reading data from csv file into R data frame
# <data frame name> <- read.csv2("<path/filename.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)
# all_groups_and_users <- read.csv2("/home/doberstein/Dropbox/D/uni/IKARion/CVK MOOC - WS18_19/analysis/t4_t5_t6_activities_with_start.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)

```

## LOAD DATASET
### Dataset contains all relevant activities (forum posts / wiki updates) for grouptasks 4,5,6 for the conditions:
### N_A: No Agent
### W_A: With Agent 

### Task4: Common_Ground
### GruppenIDs: 230 - 242

### Task5: Informationsaustausch
### GruppenIDs: 247 - 259

### Task6: Soziale Interdependenz
### GruppenIDs: 265 - 277

### For each group a "start" activity has been added to the "activity sequence" so that the startpoint for the task is apparent (e.g. to find initial inactivity)
```{r}
